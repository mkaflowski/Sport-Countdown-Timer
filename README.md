This is an application for a smartwatch, specifically designed for Wear OS. The main feature of the app is a looping timer. It counts down a set amount of time and, upon reaching zero, emits both a sound signal and a vibration alert. This functionality could be particularly useful in various scenarios, such as during a soccer game where a goalkeeper needs to be rotated out at specific intervals.
